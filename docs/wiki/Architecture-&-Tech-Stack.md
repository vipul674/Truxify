# 🏗️ System Architecture & Tech Stack

Truxify is designed as a distributed, decoupled, 6-layer architecture. It leverages microservices, smart contracts, and real-time streams to connect manufacturers and truck drivers directly and securely.

## 🎛️ Service Responsibilities

Truxify divides data storage and functionality across specialized micro-backends to maximize scalability and cost-efficiency:

| Service | Technology | Role & Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mobile Apps** | Flutter | Frontend for Customers (to post loads, track trips, run voice queries) and Drivers (to accept offers, get turn-by-turn navigation, upload documents). |
| **Main API Gateway** | Node.js + Express | Handles HTTP routing, WebSocket connections for live tracking, Firebase JWT authentication, transactional database triggers, and smart contract relayer integrations. |
| **ML Engine** | FastAPI + Python | Hosts 10 connected machine learning models for dynamic pricing, route sequence planning, cargo-to-truck matching, and return-load recommendations. |
| **Primary Relational DB** | Supabase (PostgreSQL + PostGIS) | Houses the core relational schema (27 tables) for user profiles, order metadata, bids, trips, financial ledger records, and ratings. Uses stored procedures (RPCs) for atomic wallet and order transactions. |
| **Event Database** | MongoDB Atlas | Stores high-frequency, non-relational telemetry data: driver GPS pings, user activity events, and historical telemetry data used for offline ML model retraining. |
| **Caching & Sessions** | Upstash Redis | Manages user session state, caches database query results (5-minute TTL), tracks rate-limit counters, and maintains driver presence records. |
| **Object Storage** | Cloudflare R2 | Stores unstructured binary assets such as driver license PDFs, vehicle registration RC scans, profile photos, and invoice receipts using time-limited pre-signed URLs. |
| **Trust Layer** | Polygon Ledger + Solidity | Custodies trustless payment escrows, records cryptographic hashes of driver verifications on-chain, issues immutable delivery receipts, and aggregates permanent driver ratings. |
| **Routing Service** | Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) | Computes distances, durations, and multi-stop optimal routes using free OpenStreetMap data, bypassing Google Maps API charges. |

## 🔄 Data Flow: The Order Lifecycle

The sequence diagram below represents how an order transitions from placement to delivery, highlighting the interaction between the frontend, Node.js gateway, PostgreSQL database, and Polygon ledger:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Customer App
    participant API as Node.js API
    participant PG as Supabase
    participant D as Driver App
    participant BC as Polygon

    Note over C,BC: 1. BOOKING
    C->>API: POST /api/orders (cargo + route)
    API->>PG: INSERT orders + order_timeline
    API->>PG: INSERT load_offers (broadcast to nearby)
    API-->>C: Order created ✅

    Note over C,BC: 2. BIDDING
    D->>API: GET /api/orders (view load offers)
    API->>PG: SELECT load_offers WHERE status='available'
    API-->>D: Load list
    D->>API: POST /api/orders/:id/bids (bid_amount)
    API->>PG: INSERT load_bids
    API-->>D: Bid submitted ✅

    Note over C,BC: 3. BID ACCEPTANCE
    C->>API: GET /api/orders/:id/bids (view bids)
    API->>PG: SELECT load_bids + profile + vehicle info
    API-->>C: Enriched bid list
    C->>API: POST /api/orders/:id/bids/:bidId/accept
    API->>PG: RPC accept_bid_tx (locks order, assigns driver)
    API-->>C: Driver assigned ✅

    Note over C,BC: 4. ACTIVE TRIP
    D->>API: WebSocket GPS pings
    API->>PG: UPDATE trips / trip_stops
    API-->>C: Real-time location via WebSockets

    Note over C,BC: 5. DELIVERY & ESCROW RELEASE
    D->>API: Confirm delivery (provide OTP from customer)
    API->>PG: RPC complete_trip_tx (atomic wallet settlement)
    API->>BC: Mint on-chain delivery receipt & unlock escrow
    API-->>D: Wallet credited ✅
    API-->>C: Order delivered ✅

    Note over C,BC: 6. RATING
    C->>API: POST /api/ratings (stars + comment)
    API->>PG: RPC submit_rating_tx (update database averages)
    API->>BC: Write permanent reputation on-chain

## 💾 Data Partitioning Strategy

Data in Truxify is classified into three temperature paths to optimize resource usage, query speeds, and cloud costs:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph HOT["🔥 Hot Path (Real-time)"]
        GPS["GPS Pings<br/><small>MongoDB — write-heavy, TTL indexed</small>"]
        SESS["Sessions<br/><small>Redis — 24hr TTL</small>"]
        CACHE["API Cache<br/><small>Redis — 5min TTL</small>"]
    end

    subgraph WARM["🟡 Warm Path (Transactional)"]
        ORDERS["Orders + Bids<br/><small>Supabase — ACID, RLS</small>"]
        WALLET["Wallet + Earnings<br/><small>Supabase — Atomic RPCs</small>"]
        TRIPS["Trips + Stops<br/><small>Supabase — relational</small>"]
    end

    subgraph COLD["🧊 Cold Path (Archive)"]
        DOCS["Document Files<br/><small>Cloudflare R2 — immutable</small>"]
        CHAIN["On-chain Records<br/><small>Polygon — permanent</small>"]
        ML_DATA["ML Training Data<br/><small>MongoDB — batch reads</small>"]
    end

    GPS -.->|batch ETL| ML_DATA
    ORDERS -.->|on delivery| CHAIN
    TRIPS -.->|on completion| WALLET
```

* **Hot Path (In-Memory/NoSQL)**: Handles high-throughput writes (WebSocket GPS coordinate telemetry stream) and fast-read checks (user session tokens, API rate limits).
* **Warm Path (Relational RDBMS)**: Manages structured, ACID-compliant business transactions (placing orders, accepting bids, updating driver wallet balances). Row-Level Security (RLS) is strictly enforced here.
* **Cold Path (Storage/Blockchain)**: Archival documents (license scans in Cloudflare R2), immutable receipts (blockchain smart contract logs), and historical tracking points (MongoDB offline training collections).

## 🔒 Security Model

Security is applied at the application, transport, database, and ledger levels:

* **Authentication**: Managed via Firebase Auth. The frontend logs in via phone number (OTP) and obtains a JWT token. This token is passed in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header of every API request.
* **Authorization**: The Node.js `auth.js` middleware validates the Firebase token, checks the profile in Supabase, and binds `req.user` and `req.user.role` to the request object.
* **Database Isolation**: Row-Level Security (RLS) policies are active on PostgreSQL. Clients never talk to Supabase directly; they interact only with the Express API. The API uses a secure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to perform authorized operations under strict API validation.
* **Data Integrity**: Financial ledger transactions (allocating pending balances, withdrawing funds) are processed inside Supabase using Postgres functions with explicit `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row locking to prevent race conditions or double-spending.
