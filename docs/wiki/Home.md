# 🚛 Welcome to the Truxify Wiki!

Welcome to the official technical documentation and wiki for **Truxify** — an open-source, broker-free, ML-powered, and blockchain-secured freight platform designed to connect manufacturers directly with truck owners/drivers across India.

Truxify is built to disrupt India's ₹14 lakh crore freight industry by eliminating middleman brokers (who take 30–40% commission), reducing empty return trips (deadheading), securing payments via blockchain escrow, and providing voice-based AI assistant interactions for drivers and small businesses.

## 🏗️ System Overview (The 6-Layer Stack)

Truxify divides its responsibilities across **6 distinct layers** that work together to maintain security, verify data integrity, optimize matching, and enable modern communication channels:

1. **Client Layer (Flutter)**: Separate, responsive Android/iOS apps for Customers (manufacturers) and Drivers, built with a shared common package (`truxify_shared`).
2. **Gateway Layer (Node.js/Express)**: Core API that routes traffic, authenticates tokens, manages real-time WebSockets, and integrates with backend services.
3. **Storage Layer (PostgreSQL + Mongo + Redis)**: Multi-db setup partitioning transactional data (Supabase), high-write telemetry & GPS pings (MongoDB), and sessions/cache (Redis).
4. **Intelligence Layer (FastAPI)**: Host microservice for 10 custom machine learning models handling routing, pricing, demand prediction, and matching.
5. **Trust Layer (Polygon + Solidity)**: Decentralized ledger that locks booking payments in escrow, verifies driver document hashes, and secures portable ratings.
6. **Automation Layer (n8n)**: Workflows running dispute-resolution pipelines and triggering automated ML retraining jobs.

> [!NOTE]
> All code components are designed to run on **free-tier limits** during development. Truxify is built to be self-hostable, so state transport departments, NGOs, or cooperatives can deploy the entire stack independently.
